In comparison to the original, I think the version created by chat GPT was more focused on making sense of and creating a realistic depiction over what I was able to do as a more abstract creation. I find it interesting what details were felt to be important vs which ones were made randomly, such as adding wings and legs to the creature despite not depicting any as well as interpreting the foliage as a mire. I intended to make a buglike creature to depict a horror themed piece, so I tried to focus on that angle and on something parasitic like a mosquito.
